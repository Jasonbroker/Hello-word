Welcome to Jason Digital Studio.

The app "Hello word" is for the Chinese programmers whose English are below the level.
Of course, this intro may also hard for you to read. :) BUT this is a good start point.

Just as what you have seen, this raw version is far away from complete.

lots of brand neeeeew features is erupting out of my mind, while I am a new comer in "Hello" world. :(
I am really sorry that lots of implementations are beyond me.

So I create this alpha version for help.

Let's make it beautiful and fully functional!




Thank you for your Watch, Star, Folk And Contribution!
