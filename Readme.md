#Hello word

The app `Hello word` is for the Chinese programmers whose English are below average level.
This intro may also hard for you to read. :) while that's a good start point.

Just as what you have seen, this raw version is far away from complete.

lots of brand neeeeew features is erupting out of my mind, while I am a new comer in "Hello" world. 

So I create this alpha version for help.

Let's make it beautiful and fully functional!

Thanks for your Watch, Star, Folk And Contribution!
